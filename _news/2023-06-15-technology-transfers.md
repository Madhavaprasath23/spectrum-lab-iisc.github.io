Spectrum Lab has successfully completed several technology transfers to leading industry partners:

- **Carl Zeiss India**: Technology transfer on explainable AI-based classification system for detection of retinal pathologies and volumetric computation of retinal fluid accumulation (TRL-6)
- **Boeing Data Analytics Division**: Technology transfer on explainable AI-based foreign object debris detection (TRL-6)
- **Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) Trivandrum**: Technology transfer on novel interpolation strategies for software-defined radio (TRL-7)

These collaborations demonstrate the practical impact of our research in real-world applications.
