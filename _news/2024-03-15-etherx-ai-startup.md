Prof. Seelamantula has co-founded etherX.ai, an IISc startup (incubation in process) together with Prof. Chetan Thakur from ESE, IISc. The objective of this startup is to develop AI powered imaging solutions for deployment on the edge. Their first product in the portfolio is SUSHRUT â€” a portable, handheld ultrasound imaging device developed completely in-house.
