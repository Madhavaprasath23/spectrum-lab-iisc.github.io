Our research team has published the Chákṣu database in Nature Scientific Data. Chákṣu is a glaucoma-specific fundus image database comprising 1345 images acquired using three commercially available devices. This is the largest Indian-ethnicity-specific fundus image database with expert annotations and will aid in the development of AI-based glaucoma diagnostics.
