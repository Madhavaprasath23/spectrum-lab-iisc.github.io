# People Profile Template System

This directory now uses a clean template system that separates content from presentation:

- **`person_template.md`** - Clean template with only YAML data for easy editing
- **`person.liquid`** (in `_layouts/`) - Handles all HTML structure and styling
- **`css.md`** - Example of the system in use

## How to Create a New Person Profile

1. Copy the `person_template.md` file and rename it to `[person-identifier].md` (e.g., `john-doe.md`)
2. Update the YAML front matter with the person's information
3. The layout will automatically render the profile with proper styling

## YAML Front Matter Variables

## Key Benefits of This System

- **Easy to Edit**: Template files contain only data, no HTML or CSS
- **Consistent Styling**: All profiles use the same layout and appearance
- **Maintainable**: Changes to styling only need to be made in one place (`_layouts/person.liquid`)
- **Clean Separation**: Content editors don't need to worry about HTML/CSS
- **Version Control Friendly**: Simple YAML files are easy to track and merge

## Notes

- **Layout**: Always use `layout: person` (not `layout: page`)
- **Optional Sections**: Set `show_academic_roles: false`, `show_awards: false`, or `show_visiting_positions: false` to hide sections that don't apply
- **Empty Sections**: If a section is hidden, you can leave the corresponding array empty or omit it entirely
- **Host Detection**: The template automatically handles singular vs. plural for hosts ("Host:" vs "Hosts:")
- **Styling**: All HTML and CSS is handled by the `person.liquid` layout file
- **Dark Theme**: Dark theme support is built into the layout
- **Fallback**: If you don't use `biography_paragraphs`, any content in the markdown body will be displayed as biography
